### Why?

I made this dashboard/web because I couldn\'t find a public repository anywhere(maybe I missed something).
So i thought to myself that I will do something, I did it in a couple of hours. A lot of things are missing, I could add some technical analysis stuff, but I may look into it in time, but for now I will probably focus on the trading bot. Edit it as much as you want, I\'d just like you guys to tag me or something.
         
You can maybe extend it with a login system that has shiny easy to implement or maybe a trading interface. I tried to make it as extensible as possible. Do what you feel appropriate.
